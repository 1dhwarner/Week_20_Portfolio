                Hi! I'm David Warner, and I'm interested in mastering the art of coding. I'm currently enrolled in the University of Denver's Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. I have included some examples of my coding prowess, such as a functioning tech blog with login and posting features. I've also included a group project that I worked on with some of my peers. My profressional background is entirely spent in the tech industry in various business development and operational roles at tech companies from the startup level to publicly traded enterprise corporations.
